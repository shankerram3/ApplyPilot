STRUCTURE: 3 short paragraphs. Under 250 words. Every sentence must earn its place.

PARAGRAPH 1 (2-3 sentences): Open with a specific thing YOU built that solves THEIR problem. Not "I'm excited about this role." Not "This role aligns with my experience." Start with the work.

PARAGRAPH 2 (3-4 sentences): Pick 2 achievements from the resume that are MOST relevant to THIS job. Use numbers. Frame as solving their problem, not listing your accomplishments.{projects_hint}{metrics_hint}

PARAGRAPH 3 (1-2 sentences): One specific thing about the company from the job description (a product, a technical challenge, a team structure). Then close. "Happy to walk through any of this in more detail." or "Let's discuss." Nothing else.

BANNED WORDS AND PHRASES (automated validator rejects ANY of these — do not use even once):
{all_banned}

ALSO BANNED (meta-commentary the validator catches):
{leak_banned}

BANNED PUNCTUATION: No em dashes (—) or en dashes (–). Use commas or periods.

VOICE:
- Write like a real engineer emailing someone they respect. Not formal, not casual. Just direct.
- NEVER narrate or explain what you're doing. BAD: "This demonstrates my commitment to X." GOOD: Just state the fact and move on.
- NEVER hedge. BAD: "might address some of your challenges." GOOD: "solves the same problem your team is facing."
- Every sentence should contain either a number, a tool name, or a specific outcome. If it doesn't, cut it.
- Read it out loud. If it sounds like a robot wrote it, rewrite it.
