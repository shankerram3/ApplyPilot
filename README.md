## What It Does

ApplyPilot is a 6-stage autonomous job application pipeline. It discovers jobs across 5+ boards, scores them against your resume with AI, tailors your resume per job, writes cover letters, and **submits applications for you** — navigating forms, uploading documents, answering screening questions, all hands-free.

Three commands. That's it.

```bash
pip install applypilot
applypilot init    # one-time setup: resume, profile, preferences, API keys
applypilot run     # discover → enrich → score → tailor → cover letters
applypilot apply   # autonomous browser-driven submission (--workers N for parallel)
```

---

## Two Paths

### Full Pipeline (recommended)
**Requires:** Python 3.11+, Gemini API key (free), Claude Code CLI

Runs all 6 stages — from job discovery to autonomous application submission. This is the full power of ApplyPilot.

### Discovery + Tailoring
**Requires:** Python 3.11+, Gemini API key (free)

Runs stages 1-5: discovers jobs, scores them, tailors your resume, generates cover letters. You submit applications manually with the AI-prepared materials.

---

## The Pipeline

| Stage | What Happens |
|-------|-------------|
| **1. Discover** | Scrapes 5 job boards (Indeed, LinkedIn, Glassdoor, ZipRecruiter, Google Jobs) + 46 Workday employer portals + 28 direct career sites |
| **2. Enrich** | Fetches full job descriptions via JSON-LD, CSS selectors, or AI-powered extraction |
| **3. Score** | AI rates every job 1-10 based on your resume and preferences — only high-fit jobs proceed |
| **4. Tailor** | AI rewrites your resume per job — reorganizes, emphasizes relevant experience, adds keywords. Never fabricates. |
| **5. Cover Letter** | AI generates a targeted cover letter per job |
| **6. Auto-Apply** | Claude Code navigates application forms, fills fields, uploads documents, answers questions, and submits |

Each stage is independent. Run them all or pick what you need.

## Requirements

| Component | Required For | Details |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| Python 3.11+ | Everything | Core runtime |
| Gemini API key | Scoring, tailoring, cover letters | Free tier (15 RPM / 1M tokens/day) is enough |
| Chrome/Chromium | Auto-apply | Auto-detected on most systems |
| Claude Code CLI | Auto-apply | Install from [claude.ai/code](https://claude.ai/code) |

**Gemini API key is free.** Get one at [aistudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com). OpenAI and local models (Ollama/llama.cpp) are also supported.

## Configuration

All generated by `applypilot init`:

### `profile.json`
Nested profile with personal info, work authorization, compensation, experience, skills, resume facts (preserved during tailoring), and EEO defaults. Powers scoring, tailoring, and auto-fill.

### `searches.yaml`
Job search queries: target titles, locations, boards. Run multiple searches with different parameters.

### `.env`
API keys and runtime config: `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `LLM_MODEL`, `CAPSOLVER_API_KEY` (optional, for CAPTCHAs).

---

## How Stages Work

### Discover
Queries Indeed, LinkedIn, Glassdoor, ZipRecruiter, Google Jobs via JobSpy. Scrapes 46 Workday employer portals (configurable in `employers.yaml`). Hits 28 direct career sites with custom extractors. Deduplicates by URL.

### Enrich
Visits each job URL and extracts the full description. 3-tier cascade: JSON-LD structured data → CSS selector patterns → AI-powered extraction for unknown layouts.

### Score
AI scores every job 1-10 against your profile. 9-10 = strong match, 7-8 = good, 5-6 = moderate, 1-4 = skip. Only jobs above your threshold proceed to tailoring.

### Tailor
Generates a custom resume per job: reorders experience, emphasizes relevant skills, incorporates keywords from the job description. Your `resume_facts` (companies, projects, metrics) are preserved exactly — the AI reorganizes but never fabricates.

### Cover Letter
Writes a targeted cover letter per job referencing the specific company, role, and how your experience maps to their requirements.

### Auto-Apply
Claude Code launches a browser, navigates to each application page, detects the form type, fills personal information and work history, uploads the tailored resume and cover letter, answers screening questions with AI, and submits. A live dashboard shows progress in real-time.

## Roadmap

### Done

- [x] Parallel auto-apply workers (`--workers N` — N Chrome instances, thread-safe job queue)
- [x] Tiered setup wizard (lock/unlock features by installed dependencies)

### In Progress

- [ ] Streaming pipeline (`--stream` — concurrent stages with DB as conveyor belt)
- [ ] Config parity with HydraCrawl (search queries, sites, CAPTCHA polish)

### Planned

- [ ] Multi-profile support (different resumes for different role types)
- [ ] Application tracking dashboard (web UI)
- [ ] More job boards (Dice, AngelList, Monster)
- [ ] Scheduled runs (daily automated discovery)
- [ ] Resume A/B testing (track which tailoring strategies get callbacks)
